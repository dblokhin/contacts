# Privacy Contacts

Privacy Contacts is Android contacts app that syncs your data across all your devices saving your privacy. Only encrypted data is walking on the wires backed by AES encryption.

## Mnemonic code (sentence)
Your encryption secret key is derived from special mnemonic phrase looks like:
> letter advice cage absurd amount doctor acoustic avoid letter advice cage will

A mnemonic code or sentence is superior for human interaction compared to the handling of raw binary or hexadecimal representations of secret keys. The sentence could be easy written on paper.
